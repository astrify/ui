title: Introduction to Astrify UI
description: Astrify UI is a collection of full-stack modules for React and Laravel applications. While traditional component libraries give you front-end pieces that you need to wire up yourself, Astrify UI provides complete, production-ready modules that handle both client and server-side functionality out of the box.

## Prerequisites

Astrify UI modules are tested and guaranteed to install seamlessly into applications built with the [Laravel React Starter Kit](https://github.com/laravel/react-starter-kit). If you're installing into an existing application, please ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **React**
- **Inertia.js** for seamless client-server communication
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Shadcn/ui** components installed

## Why Astrify UI?

### 1. Full-Stack Modules, Not Just Components

Every developer who runs `laravel new` and installs the React starter kit faces the same challenges: implementing file uploads, creating paginated tables, handling form validations, and more. While there are countless component libraries available, they typically only solve the front-end piece of the puzzle.

Astrify UI is different. Our modules are **full-stack solutions** that include:

- Client-side UI components built with React
- Server-side Laravel controllers and logic
- Seamless data flow between front-end and back-end
- Production-ready features like validation, error handling, and security

### 2. You Own Your Code

Unlike traditional packages that live in `vendor` directories, Astrify UI uses the [Shadcn CLI](https://ui-private.shadcn.com/docs/cli) to install modules directly into your application's codebase. This approach means:

- **No vendor lock-in**: The code becomes yours to modify and extend
- **Full customization**: Change anything to match your specific needs
- **Less dependencies**: Fewer external package to maintain or worry about updates
- **AI-friendly**: Your AI coding assistant has full context and can easily modify the code to fit your requirements
- **Transparency**: See exactly how everything works under the hood

### 3. Built on Shadcn Components

All Astrify UI modules are built using **Shadcn/ui components**, which means:

- **Seamless integration**: Fits perfectly with Laravel React applications already using Shadcn
- **Consistent styling**: Adopts your application's theme automatically
- **Highly customizable**: Despite common misconceptions, Shadcn isn't limited to the sterile gray-and-white default themeâ€”it's incredibly flexible
- **Theme-ready**: Any Shadcn theme you apply will automatically style all Astrify modules

## Why Make This?

The Laravel ecosystem has excellent component libraries for Livewire, such as Flux. We believe the React side of Laravel deserves the same level of polish and convenience. Astrify UI bridges this gap by providing React developers with the same rapid development experience that Livewire developers have enjoyed.
