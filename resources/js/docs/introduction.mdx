Astrify UI is a collection of full-stack modules for React and Laravel applications. While traditional component libraries give you front-end pieces that you need to wire up yourself, Astrify UI provides complete modules and usage examples that handle both client and server-side functionality.

## Prerequisites

Astrify UI modules and usage examples are tested and guaranteed to install seamlessly into applications built with the [Laravel React Starter Kit](https://github.com/laravel/react-starter-kit). If you're installing into an existing application, please ensure you have the following prerequisites configured for your laravel application:

- **React**
- **Inertia.js** for seamless client-server communication
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Shadcn/ui** components installed

## Why Astrify UI?

### 1. More Than Components

Every developer who runs `laravel new` and installs the React starter kit faces the same challenges. While there are countless component libraries available, they typically only solve the front-end piece of the puzzle.

Astrify UI is different. Our modules are **full-stack solutions** that include:

- Client-side UI components built with React
- Server-side Laravel controllers and logic
- Detailed usage examples that marry the two

### 2. Own Your Code

Unlike traditional packages that live in `vendor` directories, Astrify UI uses the [Shadcn CLI](https://ui-private.shadcn.com/docs/cli) to install modules directly into your application's codebase. This approach means:

- **No vendor lock-in**: The code becomes yours to modify and extend
- **Full customization**: Change anything to match your specific needs
- **Less dependencies**: Fewer external package to maintain or worry about updates
- **AI-friendly**: Your AI coding assistant has full context and can easily modify the code to fit your requirements

### 3. Built on Shadcn/UI

All Astrify UI modules are built using **Shadcn/UI components**, which means they fit perfectly with Laravel React applications already using Shadcn and work seamlessly with any Shadcn theme you apply.

## Why Make This?

The Laravel ecosystem has excellent component libraries for Livewire, such as [Flux](https://fluxui.dev/) and [Filament](https://filamentphp.com). We believe the React side of Laravel deserves the same level of polish and convenience. Astrify UI bridges this gap by providing React developers with the same rapid development experience that Livewire developers have enjoyed.
