# Getting Started with MDX in Laravel

MDX is a powerful format that combines the simplicity of **Markdown** with the flexibility of **JSX**, allowing you to create rich, interactive content with ease.

## What is MDX?

> **Note:** MDX lets you use JSX in your markdown content. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

### Key Benefits

- **🎯 Familiar**: If you know Markdown and React, you know MDX
- **🚀 Powerful**: Full access to React ecosystem
- **⚡ Fast**: Vite handles compilation and bundling
- **🎨 Flexible**: Style with Tailwind CSS

## File Structure

Our MDX files live in `resources/js/posts/` and support nested directories:

```
resources/js/posts/
├── hello-world.mdx
├── 2025/
│   ├── getting-started-with-mdx.mdx
│   └── advanced-techniques.mdx
└── tutorials/
    └── building-components.mdx
```

## Creating Your First Post

1. **Create the file**: Add a new `.mdx` file in `resources/js/posts/`
2. **Add frontmatter**: Include metadata at the top
3. **Write content**: Use Markdown with JSX components
4. **Visit the URL**: Access at `/blog/your-file-name`

### Example Post Structure

```mdx
---
title: My Amazing Post
description: This post will blow your mind
date: 2025-01-20
author: Your Name
tags: [awesome, tutorial]
---

# {frontmatter.title}

Your amazing content goes here!

<Alert>
  This is a custom component in MDX!
</Alert>
```

## Available Components

### UI Components

<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Card Component</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>
      This is a card component that you can use in MDX.
    </CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    Card content goes here. You can put any content inside cards!
  </CardContent>
</Card>

### Different Message Types

> **Success:** Success message for positive information

> **Warning:** Warning message for important notes

> **Critical:** Critical message for dangerous information

## Code Blocks

MDX supports syntax highlighting out of the box:

```typescript
// TypeScript example
interface BlogPost {
  title: string;
  slug: string;
  publishedAt: Date;
  tags: string[];
}

const post: BlogPost = {
  title: "Getting Started with MDX",
  slug: "getting-started-with-mdx",
  publishedAt: new Date('2025-01-20'),
  tags: ["tutorial", "mdx"]
};
```

```bash
# Terminal commands
npm install @mdx-js/rollup @mdx-js/react
php artisan route:list --path=blog
```

## Advanced Features

### Dynamic Content

You can use JavaScript expressions in MDX:

Current year: {new Date().getFullYear()}

Random number: {Math.floor(Math.random() * 100)}

### Interactive Elements

<Button>
  Click me for a surprise!
</Button>

## Best Practices

1. **📝 Use frontmatter** for metadata
2. **🏷️ Tag your content** for better organization
3. **📱 Keep it responsive** - components work on all devices
4. **⚡ Optimize images** before including them
5. **🔗 Use internal links** for better SEO

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Component not found | Check import statements |
| Frontmatter not parsed | Verify YAML syntax |
| Route not working | Clear manifest cache |
| Styles not applied | Check Tailwind classes |
