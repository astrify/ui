# Astrify

**Ship faster with full-stack modules for Laravel, Inertia, and React.**

Astrify provides production-ready modules that combine modern shadcn/ui interfaces with pre-wired Laravel backends. Install via the shadcn CLI for instant integration and full customization—no dependencies to manage.

## What is Astrify?

Astrify eliminates the repetitive work of building backends for common UI components. Each module includes frontend and backend logic, all wired together and ready to use. Instead of installing packages, the code is copied directly into your project, giving you 100% control to customize as needed.

## Key Features

- **shadcn CLI Integration**: Install modules using the familiar shadcn CLI workflow
- **Zero Dependencies**: All code is copied into your project for complete customization
- **Seamless Theme Integration**: Automatically inherits your app's styling and theme
- **Production Ready**: Battle-tested patterns and best practices baked in

## Available Modules

- **File Upload with S3**: Signed URLs, storage management, and image previews
- **Paginated Tables**: Server-side pagination with Laravel collections
- **More Coming Soon**: Combo boxes, data tables, and additional modules released weekly
