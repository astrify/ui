# Astrify UI

**Full-stack modules for Laravel and React.**

Astrify UI provides production-ready modules that combine modern shadcn/ui interfaces with pre-wired Laravel backends. Install via the shadcn CLI for instant integrationâ€”no dependencies to manage, just code you own.

## What is Astrify UI?

While traditional component libraries give you front-end pieces to wire up yourself, Astrify UI provides **complete full-stack modules**. Each module includes:

- React UI components built with shadcn/ui
- Laravel controllers, routes, and backend logic
- Detailed usage examples that connect everything together

The code is installed directly into your project using the shadcn CLI, giving you 100% ownership and control.
